# Origen Standard Library (OrigenStdLib)

OrigenStdLib aims to provide a standard ATE library with the following goals:

* Be agnostic to any particular company or business so that anyone can use this
* Be higher level than the native functionality provided by the tester vendors - reducing the amount of low-level knowledge required by test engineers and the footprint of custom code required to be written for a particular test program application
* Complement the Origen test program and test pattern generators (although it can be used standalone with flows and patterns originating from any backend flow)

It should be noted that this library does not aim to provide a common API across different ATE platforms, although the feature set provided by each ATE-specific variant of the library should be broadly similar.

OrigenStdLib provides libraries for the following platforms:

* [Advantest V93000 SMT 7](https://github.com/Origen-SDK/origen_std_lib)
* [Advantest V93000 SMT 8](https://github.com/Origen-SDK/origen_std_lib)

### Advantest V93000 SMT 7 Library







### Advantest V93000 SMT 8 Library

This library is still in initial development and will be documented soon.
