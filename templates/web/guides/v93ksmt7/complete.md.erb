The following complete test methods are provided to be directly called from a test suite:

* [FunctionalTest](#Functional_Test)
* [DCMeasurement](#DCMeasurement)
* [FrequencyMeasurement](#FrequencyMeasurement)

### FunctionalTest

This test will simply execute the pattern (label) defined by the test suite and will set pass/fail
depending on whether any mis-compares occur during the pattern execution.

#### Arguments

<%= render "partials/common_args.md.erb", preserve_target: true %>

### DCMeasurement

This test will execute the pattern (label) defined by the test suite and then perform a voltage or
current measurement on the given pin.

Options exist to configure the measurement and to select whether or not to run a shutdown pattern
after the measurement has been taken.


#### Arguments

* **pin (string)** - (**Required**) The name of the pin to be measured.
* **measure (string)** - (Optional, Default="VOLT") Define whether to measure current or voltage (the default).
  Set to "CURR" to measure current.
* **settlingTime (double)** - (Optional, Default=0) Specify the time to wait after running the pattern before
  taking the measurement, expressed in ms.
* **forceValue (double)** - (Optional, Default=0) The value to be forced on the pin during the measurement.
* **iRange (double)** - (Optional, Default=0) The current range to apply to the measurement in amps, it will
  be calculated if not supplied (set to 0).
* **badc (integer)** - (Optional, Default=0) When set to 1 the measurement will be made using the board ADC
  rather than the PPMU (the default)
* **applyShutdown (integer)** - (Optional, Default=1) Set to 1 to execute the pattern (label) defined
  by the `shutdownPattern` argument after the measurement.
* **shutdownPattern (string)** - (Optional, Default="<PATTERN>_part1") The name of the pattern (label) to be executed after taking
  the measurement, this argument is required if `applyShutdown` is set to 1. By default it will look for a pattern
  named after the main pattern (label) with "_part1" appended.
* **checkShutdown (integer)** - (Optional, Default=1) When set to 1 the executing of the shutdown pattern
  will be cared and the overall test will fail if any miscompares occur during the shutdown patten execution.

### FrequencyMeasurement

Measure the frequency of a clock being output on the given pin.

The pattern run by this test must setup the device to output the clock on the given pin
and then run additional cycles where the data on the pin under test is digitally captured.

The period of the capture cycles must be less than that of the clock being measured.
The effect of different settings of the capture period and the number of capture cycles should be
characterized to determine the optimal settings to meet the application's particular accuracy and
test time goals.

* **pin (string)** - (**Required**) The name of the pin to be measured.
* **periodInNs (integer)** - (**Required**) The period of the pattern's capture vectors.
* **samples (integer)** - (Optional, Default=2000) The number of digital capture cycles made by the
  pattern.
* **periodBased (integer)** - (Optional, Default=0) Set to 1 if the test limits are expressed as a
  period instead of a frequency (the default).
