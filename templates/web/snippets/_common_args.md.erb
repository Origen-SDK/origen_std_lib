  run on all pins ('@') if a port name is not supplied.
* **testName (string)** - (Optional) An explicit name to be used when logging the result of this

* **forcePass (int)** - (Optional, Default=0) When set to 1, the test will appear to always pass in the flow (produce

* **onPassFlag (string)** - (Optional) The name of a test flow variable to be set if the test fails, e.g.
  setting this to "MY_FLAG" would cause "@MY_FLAG" to be set to 1 in the event of the test passing.
  No modification will be made to the variable if the test fails.
* **onFailFlag (string)** - (Optional) The name of a test flow variable to be set if the test fails, e.g.
  setting this to "MY_FLAG" would cause "@MY_FLAG" to be set to 1 in the event of the test failing.
  No modification will be made to the variable if the test passes.
