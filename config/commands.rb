# This file should be used to extend the origen with application specific commands

# Map any command aliases here, for example to allow 'origen ex' to refer to a 
# command called execute you would add a reference as shown below: 
aliases ={
#  "ex" => "execute",
}

# The requested command is passed in here as @command, this checks it against
# the above alias table and should not be removed.
@command = aliases[@command] || @command

# Now branch to the specific task code
case @command

## Example of how to make a command to run unit tests, this simply invokes RSpec on
## the spec directory
#when "specs"
#  require "rspec"
#  exit RSpec::Core::Runner.run(['spec'])

# Example of how to make a command to run diff-based tests
