Bugfix to ensure that all components of a V93K test are logged. Previously it would stop
logging after one failed on all sites except site 1.
Now all sites will behave like site 1 and log everything.

Included the std lib files as part of the gem package, that means you can get them
from an app like this:

~~~ruby
# Copy the std lib files to include them in my app's delivery package
FileUtils.cp\_r("#{Origen.root(:origen\_std\_lib)}/stdlib/v93k", "some\_dir/origen")
~~~

Added interface helpers for implementing delayed binning:

~~~ruby
# Record that a test has failed, but don't apply yet
record\_bin(bin: 10, softbin: 100)

# Bin out if any bins have been previously applied
apply\_bin
~~~
